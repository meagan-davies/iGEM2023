                        <p class="lead">The <b>NPC1L1</b> protein is directly involved with the <b>absorption of cholesterol</b> in the lining of the small intestines, and activation of <b>NPC1L1</b> is believed to be responsible for regulating the expression of saturated fatty acid transporter proteins. Activation of <b>NPC1L1</b> requires the collection of <b>multiple cholesterol molecules</b> to be stored within the protein, and exposes a <b>binding sequence</b> that signals to bring it into the cell. We plan to <b>prevent</b> this activation by using <b>cholesterol linked to a protein</b>, to bind the outer collection site of <b>NPC1L1</b> and prevent it from sequestering further cholesterol molecules. CholesterLock will be a <b>fusion protein</b> combining a <b>cholesterol autoprocessing domain</b> from a signaling protein, with a protein that is stable in low pH and able to reach the target site.<br><br>

                            A drug using a similar <b>NPC1L1 inhibition mechanism</b> has been shown to be effective at <b>lowering LDL-cholesterol</b> in the blood, but it and many other cholesterol lowering options have <b>side effects</b> related to their breakdown in the liver, and blood sugar levels, that limit the scope of use. Utilizing the benefits of producing our therapeutic agent in bacteria, we plan to incorporate degradation signals that will be exposed when leaving the lower pH range of the target area to <b>mitigate these side effects</b>.

                        <p>In our initial plan for developing this <b>therapeutic protein</b>, we had hoped to <b>computationally model</b> our protein around unknown factors such as low pH stability and interaction with NPC1L1. After consulting with our Human Practices contacts, we came to the conclusion that this method would be <b>far more time consuming</b> than we had originally thought. The general consensus between the team and contacts was that designing experiments with proteins that have similar features would be a <b>much more feasible</b> approach. <br><br>
                        
                            To evaluate our protein’s interaction with NPC1L1 we devised a possible method of functional testing that uses <b>membrane scaffold proteins, to make structures called nanodiscs</b>, capable of suspending NPC1L1 in a soluble form. Since membrane proteins are insoluble in aqueous solutions, solubilizing NPC1L1 will allow us to <b>take advantage of the signal sequence</b> that is exposed when NPC1L1 is activated. By using suspended-NPC1L1, cholesterol, an existing protein with the same cholesterol link, and a split color producing protein with an activating site that binds to NPC1L1, it will be possible to <b>measure the inhibitory effects</b> of a cholesterol modified protein in vitro using <b>photometry</b>. <br><br>
                        </p>

                </div>
                <div class="d-sm-flex align-items-center justify-content-between">
                <p>An obvious downfall of our proposed protein would be results that show little to no interaction with NPC1L1. To overcome this possible barrier, we are also considering a different mechanism of inhibition that would include <b>endo proteolytic cleavage of the external cholesterol binding site</b> of NPC1L1 to prevent the sequestration of cholesterol. <br><br>
                        
                    <b>In regard to testing NPC1L1</b>, it will need to be produced. <b>The production of membrane proteins comes with many challenges</b>, especially when attempting to secrete eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotic bacteria. Some alternative methods have included harvesting the protein from mice or human derived intestinal cell cultures, but the required ethics approval and risk of contamination make these options unusable. <b>Our solution</b> to this problem will include developing a <b>cell-free system</b> for expression that has also been used to produce proteins in biotechnology applications outside of a lab setting for ease of use and safety. When pairing a <b>cell free system with nanodiscs</b> for purification, membrane proteins like NPC1L1 are able to be <b>produced and purified</b> in a much easier and <b>cost-effective manner</b>. The <b>nanodiscs</b> consist of <b>phospholipids</b> and a <b>membrane scaffold protein</b>, which is genetically engineered to function similar to apolipoproteins, and can be produced in bacteria. The <b>nanodiscs</b> are capable of <b>self-assembling</b> with membrane proteins and when paired with affinity tags make purification much easier. <br><br>

                    The original plan for delivery of CholesterLock was in <b>probiotic bacteria</b>, but the <b>harsh environment</b> of the stomach presented a challenge for survivability. Alternatively we considered using <b>endospores</b> to help bacteria survive past the stomach, but the reactivation out of dormancy could last too long after evacuation from stomach to small intestines that it might miss the target area. These factors influenced us to shift towards a purified protein <b>pill-delivery</b> system, moving protein production to an external environment that would be easier to control. Localization would also be more reasonable to manage by manipulating a pill capsule, and by avoiding introduction of genetically modified bacteria to the digestive system, we are able to mitigate some of the biosafety concerns involved. <br><br>

                    Although the product will <b>not be a probiotic</b>, our protein will still be <b>produced in bacteria</b>. For upscaling the production of our bacteria after development, the best option would be to use <b>bioreactors</b>. Up to about <b>4 L of media</b> can be used <b>on-site</b> for protein production, but we learned from our HP contacts that anything above is best to outsource. For possible <b>commercialization</b>, large bioreactors would be a good option, but due to the costs associated with smaller bioreactors, it would be more feasible to produce the bacteria without, for experimentation purposes. <br><br>

                    It is unlikely that we will get a working protein for our prototype based on the complexity of developing therapies for use in humans, and feedback from our mindfuel mentor. An alternate strategy that is equally as useful would be focusing on the design process with extensive feedback from future HP contacts, and highlighting pivots made as a result to increase the viability of our product, while still maintaining its original function. Although the path towards a final product is long, with a strong development process supported by a wide variety of feedback from experts, <b>CholesterLock is a viable candidate for future use as a safer, cholesterol-lowering treatment</b>. <br><br> </p>
