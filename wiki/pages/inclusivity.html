                    The promotion of diversity and inclusivity in the fields of STEM is a mission our team is very passionate about. Canada is a proud multicultural country and our iGEM Calgary team represents this Canadian identity well. Our team is composed of a diverse array of cultural backgrounds, representing eight different countries with thirteen different languages spoken among our members. 
                    <br><br>
                    Not only do we originate from different cultural backgrounds, but we come from a variety of different academic backgrounds as well. We have members studying Biological Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology, Geomatics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Biochemistry, Mechanical Engineering, Astrophysics and Nanoscience. With a vast network of perspectives from various disciplines, we truly employed a multidisciplinary approach, which is one of the core principles of synthetic biology. 
                    <br><br>
                    iGEM has given us a platform to come together as young scientists and conduct research in a welcoming and inclusive place. This year we are proud to be sponsored by the Alberta Women's Science Network (AWSN), an Albertan organisation founded on the mission of promoting diversity in STEM and advocating for equitable scientific collaboration throughout the province. Their initiatives enable a culture of inclusivity and diversity through programs that amplify and accelerate social change within the greater community, fostering an environment where all can participate in STEM to their fullest capacity. AWSNâ€™s generous sponsorship allowed us to participate in this iGEM season, and the iGEM Calgary will continue to enthusiastically promote and advocate for an inclusive and diverse scientific community. 
                    <br><br>
                    Only through unwavering efforts for systemic change can we continue making progress in eliminating the barriers that limit the diversity of perspectives able to contribute to the world of STEM.
