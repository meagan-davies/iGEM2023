                <p class="text">CholesterLock's brand identity embodies both modernity and compassion, resonating with our dedication to innovation and the well-being of our patients. With commitment to fostering hope and optimism, we invite patients to join us on a journey to better health and brighter future through innovative biotechnology.

                <h3 id="section1" class="subtitle">Project Name</h3>
                <p class="text">To enhance brand recognition and comprehension, we chose to give our project a descriptive name that captures the nature of the solution. After thorough deliberation, our team reached a unanimous verdict: our innovative fusion protein, and the entire initiative behind it, would be christened "CholesterLock." This name is elegantly straightforward, offering a clear and immediate understanding of our project's purpose. It symbolises the core function of our fusion protein â€“ locking the cholesterol receptors and blocking cholesterol synthesis and absorption. </p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 id="section2" class="subtitle">Logo</h3>
                <p class="text">With the name settled, we started developing a logo that embodies our brand personality and conveys our mission. After rounds of discussion, we have settled on the following logo:</p>

                </div>
                <p class="text">We deliberately selected a clean, contemporary typeface that not only ensures readability but also offers a visually pleasing experience. The modification of the letter "o" to resemble a cholesterol molecule adds a powerful visual element, reinforcing our dedication to addressing cholesterol-related challenges. Our warm colour palette, featuring shades of red, orange, yellow, and cream, conveys a sense of rejuvenation and vitality. These colours serve as a visual testament to the empowerment of our primary goal of improving the quality of life of patients and patient-centred treatment. </p>
