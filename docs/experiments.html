                <p class="text">A crucial part of successful experiments in the Wet Lab was ensuring consistent and extensive documentation on the protocols we used. Over the season, our team worked in a multitude of different areas encompassed by the broad umbrella of synthetic biology. In the hopes of contributing to the iGEM community, our team has curated a collection of all the optimised protocols used in our lab (alongside some helpful tips we picked up along the way!).

                    The PDF below outlines our work in the areas of Bacterial Cloning, Protein Production and  Mammalian Cell Culturing. Each protocol includes the necessary reagents and an approximation of how long it took.
