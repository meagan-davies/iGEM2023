                <p class="text">Synthetic biology was crucial in our exploration of an alternative mechanism for lowering high cholesterol. Our project contributed 22 different parts to the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, which we’ve divided into two collections. The first includes all the different parts involved in the design of our fusion protein. The second includes the parts used in the expression and characterization of our target membrane receptor, NPC1L1.</p>

                    <p class="text">Coding sequence for mouse sonic hedgehog (mShh) protein, with a 6XHis-tag at the C-terminus for purification. The hedgehog family of proteins is notable for their ability to undergo autocatalytic cleavage and a cholesterol modification. Shh is initially formed as an inactive precursor with a C-terminal and N-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain of the Hedgehog protein contains the components required for autoprocessing, while the N-terminal domain is responsible for signalling activity. In the presence of cholesterol, Shh undergoes autocatalytically-mediated cleavage between residues G257 and C258, covalently attaching a cholesterol molecule to the glycine residue. Shh can also autoprocesses with other sterol molecules, which allows for a modularity future teams can explore.</p>

                    <p class="text">
                        The design construct for our novel fusion protein. It consists of the coding sequence for the Fc-domain of IgG (BBa_K4944018) and a fragment of the coding sequence for Shh (BBa_K4944000). In between these sequences is an insertion site for a linker sequence using Golden Gate assembly.

                    <p>
                        The Fc-fragment of IgG was added to act as a chaperone and provide stability to the fusion protein in a gastrointestinal environment. By attaching an Fc-domain, we can prolong the therapeutic activity of our fusion protein by increasing its stability and half-life in the GI tract.
                        <br><br>
                        The cholesterol modification Shh undergoes is a central aspect of our fusion protein design. The stable cholesterol adduct that forms after Shh autoprocessing allows us to bind and block the cholesterol binding pocket of NPC1L1. The Shh fragment in our construct includes the sequence for the C-terminal domain and only 18 amino acids from the N-terminal domain (H181 to S437). This removes Shh signalling function while maintaining a site for cholesterol attachment. The entirety of the C-terminal domain is needed for successful autoprocessing where it will then be cleaved off and replaced with a cholesterol molecule.
                        <br><br>
                        The linker sequence between the two IgG and Shh is crucial for creating a separation between the two proteins, ensuring their structural integrity and functionality remain intact. To allow for testing of multiple linker sequences with our fusion protein design, we included an insertion site in between the IgG and Shh gene fragments. Two BsaI recognition sites were added on either end of a spacer sequence which allows us to use Golden Gate assembly to add any linker sequences with compatible overhangs into our construct.

                        We have identified 15 possible linker sequences we can test in our fusion protein. All of them are flanked by overhangs compatible with our construct and BsaI recognition sequences for easy swapability using Golden Gate assembly.
