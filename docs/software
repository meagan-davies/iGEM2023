                <h3 class="subtitle">Overview/ Motivation</h3>
                <p class="text">Designing a fusion protein presented our team with a significant challenge, notably the search for a suitable linker that aligns with our specific requirements. Constructing a successful recombinant fusion protein depends on two critical components: the component proteins and the linker. The selection of an appropriate linker sequence to connect these proteins can be a complex and often overlooked aspect of fusion protein design. Currently, the selection or rational design of linkers for fusion proteins remains an underexplored domain within the field of recombinant proteins.<br><br>
                    During our quest to find suitable linker sequences for our fusion protein, we quickly realised the limited resources and empirical methods available for selecting linkers that meet our unique needs. Existing linker databases, such as LinkerDB, and scientific literature offer limited insights into linker sequence characteristics. Additionally, assessing the behaviour of each potential linker through extensive and time-consuming molecular dynamic modelling proved impractical.<br><br>
                    To streamline the linker search process and determine initial linker characteristics, our dry lab team developed a web application called "LINKED." This tool aims to assist future iGEM teams and synthetic biologists in discovering appropriate linkers for their projects. "LINKED" serves as the foundational resource for linker sequence design. The database within the web app comprises over 1000 natural linkers, complete with their relative flexibility and hydrophobicity profiles. This data empowers users to conduct an initial screening and preliminary analysis of potential linkers, after which they can select linkers that align with their specific requirements and properties, thereby laying the groundwork for further modification to tailor the linker to their needs. <br><br>
                    Our application enables users to input their desired linker criteria and receive comprehensive information on the most suitable linkers that match those criteria. This information includes details on hydrophobic regions, flexibility, length, and, if applicable, the origin of the linkers. Furthermore, we are committed to enhance the utility of our web application by incorporating educational resources on linker sequence selection. We also intend to facilitate knowledge sharing by providing a submission form for users to document their linker sequences and contribute their research findings. Through this collaborative effort, we will continuously update the existing protein database to include empirical linker data, ensuring that "LINKED" remains a valuable resource for the scientific community.

                <h3 id="section1" class="subtitle">Data Acquisition</h3>
                <p class="text">There are two main types of linkers: natural and empirical. Natural Linkers are sequences found in naturally occurring multi-domain proteins, which can be considered as the foundation in linker design. Empirical linkers are designed by researchers to perform specific functions.<br><br>
                    Our database placed a primary emphasis on natural linkers, which are sequences naturally occurring in multi-domain proteins and serve as the foundational elements for linker design. We obtained our database from LinkerDB created by George RA and Heringa J. This database had previously undergone a comprehensive analysis of protein domain linkers and successfully extracted linker sequences from multi-domain proteins within the Protein Data Bank (PDB).<br><br>
                    Initially, our dry lab team embarked on an ambitious quest to extract natural linkers from the extensive repository of multi-domain proteins found in the PDB using rigorous data processing techniques like clustering, multiple alignment, and etc. Unfortunately, it presented us with a multitude of technical challenges. The data processing posed uncertainties due to various techniques involved, and the sheer size of the dataset proved to be overwhelming for our limited resources and technical knowledge on the subject matter.<br><br>
                    Recognizing the need to adapt our approach, we made the strategic decision to pivot the scope of our project. Instead of attempting to extract natural linkers directly from the PDB, we turned to the LinkerDB created by George RA and Heringa J. While this database represented a valuable resource, it did have some notable limitations. The user interface provided by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where the database was hosted, was outdated and not particularly user-friendly. Moreover, a critical shortcoming was the lack of comprehensive information available within this database as not enough information was provided for screening potential linkers. These challenges prompted us to consider alternative solutions to enhance the usability and completeness of the data we were working with.

                <h3 id="section2" class="subtitle">Data Processing</h3>
                <p class="text">In addition to the information already present within the database, such as PDB codes, linker length, solvent accessibility, and secondary structures or sequences, we also processed the database to include information like flexibility and hydrophobicity as they are essential design components when selecting linker sequences.<br><br>
                    Our aim is to provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of linker sequences, particularly by including vital metrics like flexibility and hydrophobicity distribution. These additional details are crucial in linker design, as they play a pivotal role in determining the functionality and stability of the linkers.

                <div class="sub-subsection">
                    <h3 id="subsection1" class="sub-subtitle">Flexibility Processing</h3>
                    <p class="text">Our flexibility calculator employs an online API tool known as DynaMine, which serves as a rapid predictor of protein backbone dynamics using only the sequence information as input. To put it simply, backbone dynamics help us understand the flexibility or rigidity of specific parts of a protein, all without the need for detailed 3D structural data. Our function takes a protein sequence and sends it to the API server, where it calculates the backbone dynamics of linker sequences.<br><br>
                        This capability offers a swift and straightforward initial assessment of protein characteristics, eliminating the need for extensive computational resources associated with molecular dynamics approaches. DynaMine predicts backbone flexibility at the residue level, presenting the data in the form of backbone N-H S^2 order parameter values. These values indicate the degree of restriction on the movement of atomic bond vectors. The algorithm's training is based on experimentally determined nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, allowing it to effectively distinguish between regions of varying structural organisation within proteins.<br><br>
                        The research team responsible for DynaMine's development has reported that this tool exhibits high performance and accuracy, comparable to the most advanced existing tools. For reference, S^2 parameters below 0.69 suggest flexibility, while values above 0.8 indicate rigidity. Values falling in between may be context-dependent, displaying characteristics of both rigidity and flexibility, depending on environmental conditions.<br><br>
                        We processed all the linker sequences with a number of amino acids greater or equal to five due to the length requirement of linkers. The linker sequences with amino acid less than five are determined to be rigid as literature stated that short linkers are usually rigid.

                    <p class="text">Hydrophobicity provides a measurement of the tendency of molecules to be soluble or repel in water. This value is significant in linker design as it provides insight into potential folding behaviour based on solubility. There are various scales that can be used to encompass the hydrophobicity of individual amino acids. For our hydrophobicity calculations we used two tables of values to provide a wider range of hydrophobicity calculations to better account for differences found through various scoring methods. </p>

These values were used to sort each amino acid in the linker into one of the following categories: very hydrophobic, hydrophobic, neutral or hydrophilic. In the calculation process the number of amino acids in each category is counted for both acidic and neutral. An average is then found and a percentage is then outputted as is shown in the following sample equation:</p>

A GRAVY score is a method for determining the overall hydrophobicity of a peptide sequence. Therefore, this method was utilised to provide insight into the overall hydrophobicity of a sequence while also providing a method to score and sort the linkers in the database.
