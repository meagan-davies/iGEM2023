            <p class="text">The long-term success of healthcare products hinges on the unwavering involvement of stakeholders throughout the entirety of product development and release. As CholesterLock our approach embraces the ethos of iterative, human-centred design- a process that demands active listening and the integration of a diverse range of beliefs and fears from our community. Our approach was rooted in crafting a solution that reflects our commitment to caring for the whole person-recognizing that their well-being extends beyond the confines of their physical body. 
              <br><br>
              Our project was sparked by a simple observation within our own families and was fuelled by our community's urgent call for change that we observed through our work in Human Practices. To address concerns about existing medications we sought guidance from field experts to help us navigate the intricacies of medicine, technology, safety, and ethics.

                    <p class="text">Confined to a strict timeline, we recognised the need to begin by identifying and categorising our stakeholders into two primary groups: <b>quantitative and qualitative</b>. The quantitative stakeholders encompass individuals who possess expertise and knowledge that can impact the design and experimental process in our product including academia professors, doctors, nutritionists and pharmaceutical companies. On the other hand, the qualitative stakeholders consist of those that would be directly affected by our product, mostly patients who have had negative experiences with existing medications for high cholesterol as well as individuals at risk of developing high cholesterol. Lastly we recognised that in order for us to learn from all the encounters we would have, we would need to reflect on them. We analysed the different models of reflection and settled on <b>Kolb's Learning Cycle Development</b> as a way to consciously explore our experiences. </p>
